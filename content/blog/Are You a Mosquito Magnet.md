Many people believe mosquitoes favor them over others — and it turns out they might be right. Here's what the science says, Different mosquito species evolved to feed on different animals. And, probably within the last 10,000 years, multiple mosquito lineages independently evolved a predilection for people. As human settlements became more permanent, they provided plenty of standing water, even through intense dry seasons, which supported mosquito reproduction year-round.

#### **How Mosquitoes Find Humans**
- **Male mosquitoes** don't seek blood they survive on plants nectar it's the **Female mosquitoes** who seek blood for egg development, for mosquitoes eggs the vertebrate blood is very important. Over the last ~10,000 years, several mosquito species evolved to prefer humans

#### **What Attracts Mosquitoes?**
Before these close encounters happen, several factors alert mosquitoes to our presence:
- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**:  Female mosquitoes can detect the CO₂ humans exhale from about 10 meters away.
- **Visual cues**:  Once they sense CO₂, they become especially interested in **dark, high-contrast objects**  
    and the **hues found in human skin**.
- **Body heat and odors**:  As they follow the CO₂ plume to its source, they eventually sense **body heat and smells**  
    generated by **microorganisms** living on our skin.
    

These microbes break down body secretions like **sweat and sebum**, producing **organic compounds** that vaporize into odors. Mosquitoes are especially attuned to these smells
#### **What Makes Some People More Attractive to Mosquitoes**

- **Temporary factors**: there are temporary factors which can make a person more attractive for example Sweat can increase your chanse of getting bitten by a beauty strengthening you body odor. Similarly alcohol and pregnancy works the same way. malaria infection ( The **Plasmodium parasite** ) can increase attractiveness.
    
- **Long-term factors**: Differences in **skin chemistry**, especially higher levels of skin **acids**, attract mosquitoes. **Genetics** may influence skin microbe composition, affecting body odor. Studies show mosquitoes are similarly attracted to **identical twins**, hinting at a genetic role.

#### Are you a mosquito magnet ?
In addition to temporary factors, about **20% of people** are thought to be naturally high attractors.  

Why this happens seems tied to **skin-specific characteristics**:
CO₂ and body heat signal general presence. But **human body odor** is more distinctive. Everyone has a unique mix of **microbial communities on their skin**, producing **different body odors**.Researchers found that **mosquitoes’ receptors** for **acidic compounds** are crucial in detecting humans. People with **more abundant skin acids** are **consistently more attractive** to mosquitoes.

Because this trait is persistent, **genes may play a role**,  possibly by influencing the **skin’s microbial composition**. Studies show mosquitoes respond **similarly to identical twins**, but **more variably to fraternal twins**, supporting a **genetic basis**. so if you turn out to a mosquito magnet , i'm sorry
