title: Is Earth Flat ?
---
Is Earth really flat. is everyone deceiving you & telling you that earth is round .you were taught at schools that the earth that we live in is round to be precise its a sphere. but your senses tell you a different story about our blue rock, as far as your eyes can see there is flat ground everywhere along with few bumps in the plane as mountains and platue. this poses a critical question in the mind.

> Is Earth Really Flat ? if not how can i know about it ( prove it ! )

##### Are you alone in this quest.
**-- NO --**  
studies and polls provide statistical data related to this theory in different regions. In the United States, surveys indicate that around 2-10% of the population may hold or entertain the idea of a flat Earth, with a 2018 YouGov poll finding 2% firmly believing it and a 2021 University of New Hampshire survey reporting nearly 10% agreement with the concept [1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/05/17/flat-earth-us-politicians/83492658007/), [2](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2024/09/10/how-many-people-think-the-earth-is-flat-and-doesnt-move/) in Brazil, recent data from 2024 shows about 20% of surveyed individuals agreeing with the statement that the Earth is flat, a significant increase from previous years [3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1131128/flat-earth-brazil/)

#### How we know Earth is round:
1. **Photos from space**:  
Satellites and space missions launched by various governmental and non-governmental bodies such as NASA, ESA, SpaceX, ISRO ,etc. have taken thousands of images and videos showing a round Earth.

Images taken during [Appollo 8 Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8) by William Anders

###### 2. **Ship visibility**: 
If you don't believe in the government then you should believe in your brain and eyes, Lets observer what happens when a ship comes form the horizon .When ships approach from the horizon, you will see the mast ( top ) before the hull ( base ), its because the Earth's surface is curved

###### 3. **Lunar Eclipse:** 

A **lunar eclipse** happens when the **Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon**, and Earth’s **shadow** falls on the Moon. This only occurs during a **full moon**.When the Earth's shadow hits the Moon during a lunar eclipse, the **shadow is always round**—**no matter where you are on Earth** or how high the Moon is in the sky.
	- Only a **sphere** always casts a **round shadow** from every angle.
	- A **flat disc** (like a coin) would cast an **oval**, **line**, or **distorted** shape depending on the angle of the light.
	- Even Aristotle (around 350 BCE) cited lunar eclipses as one of his proofs that the Earth is round.

###### 4. **Eratosthenes :**    
  
**Eratosthenes**, a Greek mathematician, wanted to find out: "If Earth is round, **how big is it**?"  
**He knew that:**
- At **noon** on a specific day (the summer solstice), in the city of **Syene** (modern-day Aswan, Egypt), the **Sun was directly overhead** — you could even see the **bottom of a deep well** because the sunlight shone straight down.
- But on that same day and time in **Alexandria**, **you couldn’t see the bottom** of a similar well — the Sun was **not directly overhead**, and it cast a **shadow**.
**Two Possible Explanations:**
1. **Flat Earth model**: The Sun is **small and close**, so its light hits the Earth at different angles.
2. **Round Earth model**: The Earth is **curved**, and the Sun is **large and far away**, so its light hits Earth in **parallel rays** — causing shadows to differ between cities.

With **just two cities**, either explanation might seem to work. But...
**Add a Third City**
- If you add **a third city**, the flat Earth model **can’t explain all the different shadow angles** at the same time.
- But the **round Earth model explains them all easily** — the angles match perfectly with Earth being a **sphere**.
