You might have at least once wondered if you are the hottest thing in the universe or Do you consider your self to be hot and are in doubt that you might not be the hottest in the room for long. well i got you !. scientifically speaking we have a limit to how cold it can get **Absolute 0** but we don't have a limit to how hot it can get we can just feed energy and make a thing hotter and hotter, if things get any hotter then the **Planck Temperature** our laws of psychs began to break. so then .....

### How Hot Can It Get ?

###### Lets talk about you
lets begain with the human body. Your internal temperature is **37 C**, 98.6 F.Sure. But those are averages. Your body's internal temperature fluctuates by about one degree Fahrenheit - half a degree Celsius - throughout the day in a cycle. But a dangerous fever is not good. 108 degrees (**42 C** ) Fahrenheit is almost always lethal.   

###### Lets move further, to your planet
The highest recorded air temperature across all of Earth has happened four times in Death Valley, where it has reached 129 degrees Fahrenheit ( **54 C** ). 180 degrees Fahrenheit (**99 C**) is the recommended temperature for water when brewing coffee. 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (**1090 C** ) is the temperature of lava fresh outta the ground. But come on. Make your own lava like Green Science Pro. By Using Fresnel lenses. 

###### What about your sun
Right up on the surface of the Sun is a different story. The surface clocks in at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit or about **5500 C** ,but the centre, where fusion occurs, is ridiculous. Temperatures there reach 28 million degrees Fahrenheit, **15 million C**. Speaking of which, the energy emitted by an object often tells us a lot about the temperature of that object. Any object over absolute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation. You and me, we don't glow visibly, but we do emit infrared light. We can't see it, but infrared cameras can. 

> Fun Fact : When matter reaches temperatures as high as those found in the center of the Sun, an enormous amount of energy is radiated away. If you were to heat only the head of a pin to the temperature of the center of the Sun, it would kill any person within 1,000 miles of it.


We can calculate the expected wavelength of radiation coming off of an object because of its temperature and that wavelength gets smaller and smaller the hotter and hotter the object gets. It goes from radio waves to microwaves up through infrared divisible, all the way to x-rays and gamma-rays, which are created in the middle of our Sun. At temperatures as hot as the Sun, matter exists in a fourth state. Not solid, not liquid, not gas but instead, a state where the electrons wander away from the nucle plasma.

>Our Sun isn't even close to being the hottest thing in the universe. I mean, sure, 15 million Kelvin is pretty incredible, but the peak temperature reached during a thermonuclear explosion is 350 million Kelvin (**349 million C**), which hardly counts, because the temperature is achieved so briefly. 

###### Lets Move Farther To Outer-space
But inside the core of a star,8 times larger than our Sun,on the last day of its life, as it collapses in on itself,you would reach a temperature of **3 billion Kelvin**. Or if you wanna be cool its **3 GigaKelvin**.  But let's get hotter. At **1 TeraKelvin**, things get weird. Remember that plasma we were talking about that the Sun is made of? Well, at 1 TeraKelvin, the electrons aren't the only thing that wander away. The hedrons themselves, the protons and neutrons in the nucleus melt into quirks and gluons, making a hot pile of soup

There's a star named WR104, about 8,000 light years away from us. Its mass is the equivalent of 25 of our Suns, and when it dies, when it collapses, its internal temperature will be so great that the energy emitted, the gamma radiation it flings out into space will be stronger than the entire amount of energy our Sun will ever create in its entire lifetime.

###### Lets move close to home
Right here on earth in Switzerland, scientists have been able to smash protons into nuclei, resulting in temperatures much larger than 1 TeraKelvin. They've been able to reach the **2 to 13 ExaKelvin range**. But we are okay, because those temperatures last for an incredibly brief moment and only involve a small number of particles. 

Remember how we could calculate the wavelength of the radiation emitted by an object based on its temperature? Well, if an object were to reach **a temperature of 1.41 times 10 to the 32 Kelvin**, the radiation it would admit would have a **wavelength of 1.616 times 10 to the -26th nano meters,** which is tiny. Like so tiny, it actually has a special name. It is the **Planck distance**, which according to quantum mechanics is the shortest distance possible in our universe.

###### Limitations.
**Okay, well what if we added**
even more energy? Wouldn't the wavelength get smaller? It's supposed to, but yet it can't. This is where we've got a problem. Above **1.41 times 10 to 32 Kelvin, the Planck temperature**, **our theories don't work. The object would become hotter than temperature** Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount of energy we could keep adding into the system. We just don't know what would happen if it got hotter than the Planck temperature. 

Classically, you could argue that that much energy in one place would instantly cause a black hole to form. **And a black hole formed from energy has a special name - a Kugelblitz**. So basically, what I'm trying to say is when you want to tell someone you like that you think they are hot, so hot that not even science can understand it,
just call them a **Kugelblitz**.
